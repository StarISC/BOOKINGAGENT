    <h1>Royal Caribbean pricing explorer</h1>
    <p>
        This portal will surface pricing data that we retrieve from the Royal Caribbean Cruise
        Pricing API described in <code>document/RCL Cruise FIT Spec 5.2.pdf</code> (see the sections
        around pages 162-205 for <code>OTA_CruisePriceBookingRQ</code> / <code>RS</code> details).
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is to keep the pricing breakdown aligned with the OTA schema, replaying the
        sailing, reservation and guest-level components that the API returns.

    <h2>Progress so far</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>API review</strong>: Captured the Cruise Price Booking request/response attributes
            (sailing info, booking payment primitives, guest price info, promotion codes) from the
            PDF so we know what needs to be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data model</strong>: Added domain records that mirror <code>BookingPayment</code>,
            <code>GuestPrice</code> and sailing structures in <code>src/BookingAgent.Domain/Models/CruisePricingModels.cs</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>UI scaffolding</strong>: Set up the shell layout, placeholder pricing service and
            routing necessary for the Blazor pages that will later bind to the live API.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Configuration notes</h2>
    <p class="muted">
        Sensitive details such as the database connection string and API credentials are intentionally
        left as placeholders in <code>src/BookingAgent.App/appsettings.json</code> and
        <code>src/BookingAgent.App/appsettings.Development.json</code>. Replace the markers
        (e.g., <code>&lt;your-server&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;your-api-password&gt;</code>) with the
        authorized values in a secure way (environment variables or user secrets) when the app is deployed.
    </p>

        Current environment: Windows Server 2016 connecting to SQL Server 2019, targeting Royal Caribbean's
        API through secured SOAP endpoints.
